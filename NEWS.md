# RadialMR v1.2

* RadialMR now requires R 4.1.0 or newer. This is due to a dependency of ggplot2, the scales package, having this requirement (which is the new tidyverse requirement given the release of R 4.5.0).

# RadialMR v1.1

* Fixed warning in `plotly_radial()`

* Helpfile examples are now conditional on the use of packages in the Suggests list

# RadialMR v1.0

* Initial release of package
